The Calculator project in your GitHub repository appears to be a simple web-based calculator built using HTML. While the available files are minimal, the project likely provides a basic arithmetic calculator that allows users to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

How It Works
User Interface:

The calculator interface is built using HTML, where buttons for numbers (0-9) and operations (+, -, *, /) are displayed.

Functionality:

When a user clicks a button, the corresponding value (number or operator) is added to an input field.

Once the user enters an equation, clicking the "=" button calculates the result and displays it.

Processing Logic:

The logic for performing calculations is typically handled using JavaScript, but the current repository doesn't show JavaScript files, meaning the functionality might not be fully implemented.
